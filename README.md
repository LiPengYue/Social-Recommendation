# Summary of social recommendation
This repository summarizes some existing social recommendation papers and open source codes, provides downloads of the papers and attaches the corresponding code addresses.If there are other open source projects that I have not collected about social recommendations, I hope you to contact me.

社会化推荐总结

这个仓库总结了一些现有的社会化推荐论文和开源代码，提供了论文的下载并且附上了对应的开源代码地址。如果还有其他我没收集到的关于社会化推荐的开源项目，希望与我联系。(路过的朋友点一下star吧)

另外我有在知乎写一篇关于社会化推荐的文章，欢迎点赞：https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/190944012
